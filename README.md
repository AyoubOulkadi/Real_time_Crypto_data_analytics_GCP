<h3>Data Collection from Binance API</h3>


Retrieve historical data from the Binance API using Python and store it in a suitable data structure

**Data Collection**: The pipeline begins by fetching real-time cryptocurrency market data from the Binance API. This includes information such as price, volume, and order book data for various cryptocurrencies.

**Real-Time Streaming**: We leverage streaming technologies to ensure that our pipeline can handle continuous data updates. Real-time streaming ensures that our analysis remains up-to-date with the dynamic cryptocurrency market.

**ETL Processing (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Data collected from the Binance API often requires cleaning, transformation, and enrichment to be useful for analysis. Our ETL process handles these tasks efficiently, making sure your data is ready for analysis.

**Data Storage**: Processed data is securely stored in a data repository, ensuring data integrity and easy access for future analysis. You can choose from a variety of storage solutions, depending on your requirements.

**SQL Transformations**: SQL-based transformations can be applied to the stored data to generate meaningful insights and reports. You can perform complex queries and aggregations to gain deeper insights into the cryptocurrency market.

**Data Visualization**: The final step involves visualizing the data using charts, graphs, and dashboards. This allows you to communicate your findings effectively and make informed decisions based on the analyzed data.
